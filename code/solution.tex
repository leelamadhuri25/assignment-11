\section{explaination}
The time period doubles for very successive pass from one flip-flop to other.\\
  Let the initial time period and frequency be T,F as the time period is getting doubles so
  time period at $Q_1$ =2T\\\
  Similarly at $Q_2$=4T ; at $Q_3$=8T ; at $Q_4$=16T\\\
so the time period is getting increased in the form of $2^{n}T$ where n can take the value of required output.\\\\
So,frequency at $Q_4$ can be F=$\frac{1}{T \  at \  Q_4 }$\\\
F=$\frac{1}{16}$\\\ {(as initially F=1MHz so T at initial=1 sec)}\\\
Also frequency can be written as F=$\frac{1}{2^4}=\frac{1}{16}$=62.5KHz
